## Week-3 lab observation:

The program loads the values 1 and 2 from memory into registers. It then swaps these values by 
storing 2 in the location where 1 was and 1 in the location where 2 was. This results in the values 1 
and 2 being swapped in memory. After execution, the memory locations originally holding 1 and 2 
will have 2 and 1, respectively.
